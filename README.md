geosupportsystem
================

Scripts to aid in the setup of geospatial systems, etc.

The script is in Swedish and can be found in the geoserver.sh file.

To use the script just run it on a Linux Ubuntu 12.04 Server as root:

sudo su
sh geoserver.sh

Use the "RAW" link and wget to copy the script to the server first:

wget https://github.com/klakar/geosupportsystem/raw/master/geoserver.sh

Good Luck!
