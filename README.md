geosupportsystem
================

Scripts to aid in the setup of geospatial systems, etc.

The script is in Swedish but works fine in any language.

<b>Complete Geoserver install</b>

To use the script just run it on a Linux Ubuntu 12.04 Server as root:

<i>sudo su<br>
sh geoserver.sh</i>

Use the "RAW" link and wget to copy the script to the server first:

<i>wget https://github.com/klakar/geosupportsystem/raw/master/geoserver.sh</i>

Good Luck!
